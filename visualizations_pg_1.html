      <h5>Concentration of Individual Contributions By State in 2022 Election Cycle</h5>
      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
        <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="file:///C:/Users/megri/Downloads/Principles%20of%20Computing/PC%20Final%20Project%20All%20Files/data_viz_2_by_contributions.html" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <p>This visualization depicts the differences between the total number of contributions to candidates in each state. The clear outliers - California, Florida, and Georgia - received between 200 million and 300 million individual contributions. While this map does not measure the monetary value of these donations, passing the mouse over state outlines will allow you to interact with the visualization and reveals the total number of individual contributions received by state. Georgia is the single largest recipient of donations, which is most likely a result of the closely contended Senatorial special election held during the 2022 election cycle. California and Florida received the second and third most number of donations, likely due to both the states' populations and reputations as potential swing states with large numbers of electoral votes. Indeed, this trend of greater numbers of contributions was focused primarily in more populated states such as Texas and New York, as well as common swing states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio. </p>

        <h5>Total Individual Contribution Numbers By Year</h5>
        <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
          <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="file:///C:/Users/megri/Downloads/Principles%20of%20Computing/PC%20Final%20Project%20All%20Files/data_viz_1_by_contributions.html" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>The individual contributions shown in the chart above are reflective of civic engagement and monetary investment in election outcomes. Most notably on this graph, between 2017 and 2020 the number of contributions broke records each subsequent year, surpassing 300 million donors by 2021. It could be speculated that the party divide widened as a result of the 2020 and 2022 elections, resulting in a quasi-contributorial activism. Another similarly speculative explanation for the sharp rise in donations could be the increased accessibility of donating via campaign platforms and fundraising websites such as ActBlue and WinRed. </p>
